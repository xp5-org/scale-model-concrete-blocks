# scale-model-concrete-blocks


 CAD files for concrete molds, to create linkable cement blocks. these are 3d printable and include the .STL and .F3D file
 - sized for 80x40x40mm



these can be poured using regular concrete mix. The blocks must be vibrated including the forms for best results. Pouring without vibration is possible but will result in malformed features. 

3d print info:
- avoid printing these in orientation where supports are laid across the features, it becomes incredibly tedious to sand the smallest of errors and any bumps or irregularities in the 3d printed surface can cause significant difficulties in releasing the forms after curing. 

How i mix my concrete for the small blocks:
- make it more wetter than typical. Not runny or dripping. Low or no slump. This compromises the strength, but we do not need much strength at this scale and size.
- mostly sand, about 50% sand and 30% cement and 20% pea gravel
- apply oil or grease to the features of the form, use a small brush to get a light even coating. spray-on oil can work but leaves behind bubbles which may interfere with pouring, it is better to brush on to ensure no air entrapment.
- using two C-clamps per form with light tension (only enough to ensure the 3d printed material is sitting flat) with a wide board or piece of metal for the bottom and two smaller pieces for the top (leaving an entrance to pour). overtop of the bottom wood/plate, a piece of plastic or wax paper can be laid overtop it to prevent damaging from caustic concrete mixture and also improves the finished product
- use a shaker, or vibrator motor to vibrate the cement form. At this scale it is not practical to use a small scale vibrator, rather we can shake the entire form assembly to encourage the sand to settle out of the aggregate and into the feature points and recesses. 

after mixing , vibrating to remove air pockets is critical. Once done, remove the clamps and top wood pieces carefully, let it sit for about 4-6 hours (depends on temperature and humidity). Once the concrete has dried enough to not be disturbed by a light touch, gently submurge the form in water deep enough to cover the concrete. Once it is underneath water, it will cure within 48 hours we can remove the forms. sometimes as soon as 24 hours if it is in a warm environment

Tips:
- it is better to UNDER fill the form, than over-fill. do not over-fill the form! the blocks will not fit together if they are too wide (over-filled).
- Shrinkage will occur, if you fill right to the edge and it cures, the final block will have some shrinkage and this is OK, but if you want closer tolerances and less gaps in the finished product, use less water in the cement mixture or a "water reducing additive" (superplasticizer) 
- Always vibrate, its better to shake it too much than not enough. I run the vibration at least 10 seconds after the last bubbles rise. This compromises the mixture, sand precipitates out from the aggregate BUT results in a better finish and less errors. 

Curing:
- Concrete (portland cement) needs water to cure. it does not cure when it is dry. Placing the forms underneath water while it is curing, ensures the mixture is strong enough to remove at 48hrs without ripping the features off

Surface irregularities: 
- this was printed at 0.2mm "draft" resolution and the resulting layer-lines transferred through to the final product
